# Creating Your Own List

- Read the [awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md) and ensure your list complies.
- Wait at least a couple of weeks after creating a list before submitting to this list to give it a chance to mature.
- Search this list before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate. If it is, try and contribute to the best one instead of making your own.
- A link back to this list from yours, so users can discover more lists, would be appreciated. 
- Make sure you read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md) before submitting a request for your list to be added here.

Thanks for being awesome!
