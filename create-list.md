# Creating Your Own List

- Read the [awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md) and ensure your list complies.
- Search this list before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate. If it is, try and contribute to the best one instead of making your own.
- Your awesome list should be named `awesome-list-name` and have the [awesome badge](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md#awesome-badge), a [license](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md#choose-an-appropriate-license), and [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md#include-contribution-guidelines). Adding a [code of conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/) is also strongly recommended. You might find [this Yeoman generator](https://github.com/dar5hak/generator-awesome-list) useful.
- **Wait at least 30 days after creating a list before submitting it, to give it a chance to mature.**
- Make sure you read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/contributing.md) before submitting a request for your list to be added here.

Thanks for being awesome!
